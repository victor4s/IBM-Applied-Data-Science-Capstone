This repository presents the final project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course on Coursera. The objective is to carry out a data science project from start to finish using all the knowledge and tools learned during the certificate. That is, from data collection using RESP APIs or Web Scraping websites, through data treatment and, later, exploratory analysis both through graphics and SQL queries. In addition, dashboards elaboration and finally the creation of a machine learning model according to the type of problem faced.
That said, the task to be performed is based on the launch data of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, where this entire process mentioned above was carried out in order to find out whether a future launch will be successful or not. Each project step is documented in this repository in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.
